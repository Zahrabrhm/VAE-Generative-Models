# VAE-Generative-Models
This repository contains implementations and experiments with various types of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) applied to the MNIST dataset. VAEs are generative models that learn to encode and decode data in a probabilistic manner, making them particularly useful for image generation tasks.
